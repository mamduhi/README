Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the repository of Vahid Mamduhi

I am a PhD in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science turned Data Scientist.

Having a background in academia helps me to understand the data and apply both analytical and creative approaches.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently collaborating with academia on data science related projects in Autonomous Systems.

I attended intensive courses on Python Programming & Data Science at [Constructor Academy](https://academy.constructor.org), where I learned hands-on . I work with the following technologies:

Python, Web Scraping, APIs
Visualization (incl. Interactive) with Python, Plotly, Matplotlib, Streamlit
Machine Learning - scikit-learn, regression, anomaly detection, clustering, ensemble methods
Deep Learning - Tensorflow, Keras, neural networks, CNNs, transfer learning, image segmentation, object detection
Natural Language Processing - text classification, summarization, clustering and similarity, machine translation, sentiment analysis, search and information retrieval, parsing and named entity recognition, classical NLP and transformers
ML Engineering - SQL, Docker, CI/CD, serving models, MLFlow
Explainable AI - SHAP, GradCam, Lime, etc
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in contributing to open source projects.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting Data projects.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to start a career in Data Science.
